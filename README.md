# Movie Database Project

A structured relational database to store, manage and query movie-related data such as movies, directors, actors, genres and earnings.

Mapped database using a UML-based Entity-Relationship diagram to model key entities, relationships and attributes.

Normalized tables to 3rd normal form eliminating data redundancy and guaranteeing data integrity, while also simplifying the query process.

Created database using MySQL, defining all tables using DDL commands with appropriate data types,
constraints, primary and foreign keys. Designed DML statements to populate sample data.

Added sample SQL queries.
